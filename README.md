# Scene Sage ðŸŽ¬

**Scene Sage** is a Python tool that splits a `.srt` subtitle file into scenes and analyzes each scene using a Large Language Model (LLM) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). It generates a summary, character list, mood, and cultural references for each sceneâ€”saving the result in a structured JSON file.

## Features

- **Automatic scene splitting:** Groups subtitles into scenes using time gaps (default: 4 seconds).

1
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,759
Greetings, my friend. We are
all interested in the future,

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,507
for that is where you and I
are going to spend the
rest of our lives.

3
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:37,365
And remember my friend, future
events such as these will affect
you in the future.

4
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:43,830
You are interested in the
unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

5
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,072
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time,

6
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:54,133
we are bringing to you the full story of what
happened on that fateful day.

7
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:58,678
We are giving you all the evidence, based
only on the secret testimony

8
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:02,416
of the miserable souls who survived

9
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,557
this terrifying ordeal. The
incidents, the places,

10
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:12,617
my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer.
Let us punish the guilty,

11
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:18,173
let us reward the innocent. My friend,

12
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:23,425
can your heart stand the shocking facts
about grave robbers

13
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:24,435
from outer space?

14
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,889
All of us on this earth, know that
there is a time to live,

15
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:54,434
and that there is a time to die,
yet death is always a shock

16
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,364
to those left behind.

17
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:05,444
It is even more of a shock, when death,
the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.

18
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:10,293
Just at sundown, a small group,

19
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:13,323
gathered in silent prayer around
the newly-opened grave

20
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:18,475
of the beloved wife of an elderly man.
Sundown of the day,

21
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:22,717
yet also the sundown of the old man's heart,

22
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,272
for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.

23
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:44,939
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.

24
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:11,908
It was when the gravediggers started their task

25
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:15,949
that strange things began to take place.

26
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:22,211
Fifteen to four.

27
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,130
Yup, right on schedule. There's the
ol' San Fernando Valley

28
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,767
out there now.
-You better radio in

29
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,302
for landing instructions, Danny.
-Right, Jeff.

30
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:35,342
Burbank Tower, this is American
Flight 812, over.

31
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:39,686
Wouldn't surprise
me any if  he's asleep this time of the morning.

32
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,928
American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
If I were asleep

33
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:47,968
you'd never get on the ground!
Your case maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.

34
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:53,221
You got me that time, Mac.
This American Flight 812 requesting -

35
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:02,918
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

36
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,958
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

37
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:11,100
Holy mackeral.
-Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,

38
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,726
are you in trouble?

39
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:18,069
-Trouble ?
-Take a look for yourself.

40
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:23,928
-What in the world...
-That's nothing from this world.

41
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:28,069
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,
are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?

42
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:32,109
-Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
-Do you suppose the passengers saw it?

43
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:36,049
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.

44
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:39,483
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.

45
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:43,523
-Right.
-American Flight 812 reporting to Burbank Tower, over.

46
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,027
(buzzing noise)

47
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:13,119
-D'you hear anything ?
-I thought I did.

48
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,442
Don't like hearin' noises.
'Specially when there ain't s'posed to be any.

49
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:19,079
-Yeah, sorta spooky-like.

50
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,513
-Maybe we're getting' old.
-Whatever it is it's gone now.

51
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:24,129
-That's the best thing for us too. Gone.

52
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,169
-Yeah, let's go.

53
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,234
(The two men scream.)

54
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,240
The grief of his wife's death

55
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,280
became greater and greater agony.

56
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,270
The home they had so long shared together,
became a tomb.

57
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:23,825
A sweet memory of her joyous living.

58
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:30,492
The sky to which she had once looked,
was now only a covering for her dead body.

59
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:50,997
The ever-beautiful flowers she had
planted with her own hands,

60
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,340
became nothing more than the
lost roses of her cheeks.

61
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,239
Confused by his great loss, the old man

62
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:09,279
left that home,
never to return again.

63
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:11,838
(tires screeching; the man cries out in pain)

64
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:17,904
(ambulance horn)

65
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:26,855
At the funeral of the old man,
unknown to his mourners,

66
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:32,107
his dead wife was watching.

67
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,845
-First his wife, then he.
-Tragic.

68
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:39,279
-Tell me something. Why was his wife buried in the ground,
and

69
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,208
he sealed in a crypt?
-Something to do with family tradition.

70
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,441
A superstition of some sort.

71
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,481
Well, it's getting' dark. Let's be on our way.

72
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:57,546
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting placeâ€¦

73
00:08:57,546 --> 00:09:00,363
(screams) Look!

74
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:36,652
Minutes later, the police, led by Inspector Daniel Clay,

75
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,874
arrived at the scene.

76
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:42,107
-Who found him ?
-The man and girl.

77
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:46,147
-Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
-Just left.

78
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,379
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.
-You get their

79
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,420
statement ?
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.

80
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,066
-Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.

81
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,409
Have one of the boys take the guy
and the girl back to town. You take charge.

82
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,440
-Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?

83
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,975
-Look around a little.
-Pretty dark out there.

84
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,207
Once you get beyond the range of those lights you won't be
able to see your hand in front of your face.

85
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:15,338
-I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.

86
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:19,379
-You be careful Clay.
-I'm a big boy now, Johnny.

87
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:19,277
Looks like a bobcat tore into them.

88
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,297
Yeah.

89
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,752
Say Lieutenant,

90
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,792
d'you get that funny odour ?
-How could I miss it ?

91
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,327
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.

92
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:39,277
-That's the fifth siren in the last hour.
-Oh, something's happened down at

93
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:43,317
the cemetery. A lot of police cars and lights.
I stopped but I didn't see anything.

94
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:48,267
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning paper
will carry the whole story.

95
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:58,166
You seem to still be up there somewhere.

96
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,590
Maybe I am.

97
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,630
I don't think I've ever seen you
in this mood before.

98
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:10,388
I guess it's because I've never been
in this mood before.

99
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:17,256
Something about your flight ?

100
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:20,186
Yeah.

101
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:24,226
What happened, Jeff ?

102
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:32,913
-I saw a flying saucer.
-A saucer?

103
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:36,953
You mean the kind from up there?
-Yeah, or its counterpart.

104
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:42,206
It was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan either saw it too.

105
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:46,246
When it passed over, the whole compartment
lighted up with a blinding glare.

106
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:49,680
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically
knocked us off our course.

107
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,721
-Well did you report it?
-Yeah, I radioed in immediately and they said well

108
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:57,862
keep it quiet until you land.
Then as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us

109
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:02,104
and made us swear to
secrecy about the whole thing.

110
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:06,246
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been seen for years.
They're here, it's a fact.

111
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:10,286
And the public oughta know about it.
-There must be something more you can do about it.

112
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:14,326
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the use of making a fuss.

113
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:19,074
But last night I saw a flying object that
couldn't possibly have been from this planet.

114
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:24,831
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army brass!
I can't even admit I saw the thing!

115
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:28,643
(loud whooshing noise)

116
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:53,355
(another whooshing noise)

117
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:37,760
(door creaks open)

118
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:31,598
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.

119
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,742
(Gun is empty.)

120
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:39,817
(Clay screams and chokes.)

121
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,911
Bet that apparition we saw had
something to do with it.

122
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:43,921
Come on.

123
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:11,698
-Is he dead ?
-Yeah.

124
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:16,142
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

125
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,779
S'pose that saucer or whatever it was
had something to do with this?

126
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,809
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.

127
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:26,647
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead...

128
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:30,688
murdered...and somebody's responsible!

129
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:33,516
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.

130
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:37,556
-Yeah, guess I am. Kelton.
-Yes Sir ?

131
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:41,597
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.

132
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,718
Well how 'bout the lab boys ?

133
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:47,758
Well who do you think we left back at the car,
boy scouts ? Come on, Larry.

134
00:16:54,627 --> 00:17:00,687
Greater love hath no man, than to
lay down his life for another.

135
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:04,324
It is always difficult to have last words

136
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:09,374
over the grave of a friend.
And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.

137
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:14,122
A dear friend to me and to all of us.

138
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:18,768
The bell has rung upon his great career.

139
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:26,445
Now we lay him to rest. A rest well deserved, but so premature.

140
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:42,808
People turning south from the freeway
were startled when they saw

141
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:46,848
three flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

142
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,030
A woman, startled by the sight in the
sky, telephones the police.

143
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:31,999
There comes a time in each man's life,

144
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,040
when he can't even believe his own eyes.

145
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:42,605
Saucers seen over Hollywood!

146
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,060
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.

147
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:58,060
The army convoy moved into the field.

148
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,605
Rockets were quickly set up.

149
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:16,342
Colonel Tom Edwards, in charge of saucer field activities,

150
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:19,575
was to make the greatest decision of his career.

151
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,615
He made that decision. Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.

152
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:33,210
Then as swiftly as they had come,
they were gone.

153
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,251
Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.

154
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,867
-Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
-A sight I'd rather not be seeing.

155
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,887
-Are you worried about them Sir ?

156
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:52,907
Well, they must have a reason for their visits.

157
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:59,978
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors!
Are big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?

158
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,220
We haven't always fired at them.

159
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,260
For a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.

160
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:14,624
Then they attacked a town. A small town, I'll admit.
But nevertheless a town of people.

161
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:19,068
People who died.
-I never heard about that Sir.

162
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:24,119
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon. Take any fire,

163
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:28,058
any earthquake, any major disaster,

164
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:31,088
then wonder.
Flying saucers, Captain,

165
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,816
are still a rumour.

166
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:34,321
Officially.

167
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,381
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.

168
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:44,422
What do they want...where are they from...where are they going...

169
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:47,856
They, Sir ? Who ?

170
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:52,199
Oh, this is a training maneuver, Sir.
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

171
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,543
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.

172
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,320
What will their next move be?

173
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:22,805
Your space commander has returned from Earth.

174
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:23,815
Send him in.

175
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:33,613
You have your report?

176
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,542
We had to pull in here to
Space Station 7 for regeneration.

177
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,572
We're returning to the planet Earth
immediately thereafter.

178
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:44,421
-What progress has been made?
-We contacted government officials.

179
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:46,239
They refuse over existence.

180
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,279
What plan will you follow now?

181
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,320
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

182
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,138
Their soul is too controlled.

183
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:02,703
Plan 9...ah yes. Plan 9 deals

184
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,330
with the resurrection of the dead.

185
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,370
Long-distance electrodes shot into the pinion
pituitary glands of recent dead.

186
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:13,713
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ?
-Yes Excellency.

187
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:16,239
How successful has it been ?

188
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:20,279
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.

189
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,329
The living...they have no suspicion of your movements ?

190
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,653
We had to dispose of one policeman.

191
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:32,097
However, none of those risen have been seen.
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.

192
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:37,350
It's too bad it must be handled this way. But it must.

193
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,996
Those who we take from the grave will lead the way for our other operations.

194
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:45,935
Yes, Excellency.
-Continue on. Report to me

195
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,955
in two Earth days.

196
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:54,319
I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.

197
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,652
Well had he been dealing with our own people
his reaction would have been completely different.

198
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,087
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.

199
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:05,127
What do you think will be the next obstacle
the Earth people will put in our way?

200
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:09,268
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.

201
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:15,834
But those whom we're using cannot think. They are the dead.
Brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns.

202
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:22,703
You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider...the Earth people, who can think,

203
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:26,844
are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.

204
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:31,894
Well our ship should be regenerated. We better get started.

205
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:30,278
I still think you oughta go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.

206
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:35,429
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.

207
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:39,469
Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to Momma.

208
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:43,914
-That's not the point.
-That's all the point there's going to be.

209
00:25:43,914 --> 00:25:47,954
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine, Darling.
But if you see any more

210
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:52,702
flying saucers, will you tell them to pick another house to buzz?

211
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:57,045
Be careful. Don't worry about me.

212
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:01,085
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about. Oh forget about the flying saucers.

213
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:07,651
They're up there. But there's something in that cemetery,

214
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,984
and that's too close for comfort.

215
00:26:10,984 --> 00:26:14,924
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.

216
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:21,590
But I'll be locked up in there. Now off to your wild blue yonders.

217
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:24,014
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately ?

218
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:28,055
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed before half an hour is gone,

219
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,388
with your pillow beside me.
-My pillow ?

220
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:35,428
Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.

221
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:44,620
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,
I reach over and touch it, then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.

222
00:26:47,448 --> 00:26:48,863
A crazy kid.

223
00:26:57,852 --> 00:27:00,883
Well I do love you, Darlin'.

224
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,256
See you Thursday.
-Goodbye, Honey.

225
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:24,216
You know I'm not leaving here until you're locked safely inside.

226
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:28,256
All right, Darling.

227
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:41,791
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.

228
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:46,337
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.

229
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:10,882
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.

230
00:28:10,882 --> 00:28:12,902
You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff.

231
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:16,134
I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.

232
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:19,266
We've got thirty-three passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied.

233
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,801
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity.

234
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,932
I guess you're right, Danny.

235
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:29,164
-Paula ?
-Yeah.

236
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:32,397
-There's nothing wrong between you two ?
-Oh no, nothing like that.

237
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:36,033
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and

238
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:40,435
those incidents in the graveyard these past few days. It's just got me worried.

239
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:45,629
Well, maybe they haven't figured out those crazy skybirds yet, but
I give you 50:1 odds

240
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:48,053
the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.

241
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:51,386
-I hope so.
-If you're really that worried Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?

242
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:56,437
Mac should be on duty at the field by now.
He could call Paula and relay the message to you.

243
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:01,285
-Hi Edith.
-Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this end of the plane since we left the field.

244
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,922
Jeff's been giving me and himself a study in silence.

245
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:08,154
-You boys aren't feudin'?
-Oh no Edie, nothing like that.

246
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:10,881
Hey Edie, how about you and me balling it up in Albuquerque ?

247
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:14,517
Albuquerque ? Have you read that flight schedule Boy ?
-What about it ?

248
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:18,558
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am. That's strictly a nine o'clock town.

249
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,083
Well I know a friend that'll help us --

250
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,517
-Let's have a problem first, huh Danny?
-Ah he's worried about Paula.

251
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:29,534
I read about that cemetery business.
I tried to get you kids not to buy too near one of those things.

252
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,598
We'll get there soon enough as it is!

253
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,315
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.

254
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,749
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.

255
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,285
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.

256
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:44,820
Say, I almost forgot what I came in here for.
How's the coffee situation?

257
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,951
-Mmmm that's for me.
-That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.

258
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,992
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff, make that call to Mac.

259
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:56,537
Huh, not only will she throw water on my Albuquerque plan but now she's
repeating herself.

260
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:00,780
-How 'bout that Albuquerque ball?
-I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.

261
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:12,093
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder

262
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,921
and the flash of lightning.

263
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:19,769
But from the blast, arose the moving figure of the dead old man.

264
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:42,155
(telephone rings)

265
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:52,496
Hello? Who?

266
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:56,637
Mac? Well, hi Mac!

267
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,062
Sure I'm all right.

268
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:01,082
I just fell asleep.

269
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:06,738
Tell Jeff I'm all right.

270
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:10,779
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.

271
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:49,532
(she screams)

272
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,197
(she screams)

273
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:40,473
Mrs. Trent! Mrs. Trent! What's wrong?

274
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:57,999
(police siren)

275
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:59,967
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.

276
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,320
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.

277
00:37:50,774 --> 00:37:53,400
It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.

278
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,441
-I don't think the Lieutenant does either.
-Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.

279
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:01,885
Ah don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hard hat just like you.

280
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:11,986
What do you suppose that noise was?

281
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:15,925
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.

282
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:19,360
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.

283
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,400
-Heh. Maybe.
-The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.

284
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:27,440
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
She didn't have anything on her breath.

285
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,481
-She was hysterical.
-Well true, she was frightened, and in a state of shock.

286
00:38:31,986 --> 00:38:36,026
But, don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.

287
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:43,602
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.
I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant

288
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:46,329
and I'm still a uniformed cop.

289
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:48,753
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry. In the meantime let's get-

290
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:51,683
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant! Did you hear that?
-How could we help it?

291
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:53,602
-It sure was strange.
-Know what it was?

292
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:57,036
-No more than you do.
-If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.

293
00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:59,460
-It was a saucer.
-A flying saucer? What makes you say that?

294
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,086
You remember the noise we heard the other night?

295
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,612
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget?

296
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:08,450
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.

297
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:13,500
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
I'm with the fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?

298
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:18,248
Well haven't you heard?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow,

299
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:22,793
or a light of any kind for that matter.
-That proves it. What next Lieutenant?

300
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,561
Oh, Lieutenant! Maybe this doesn't mean much,
but uh Jamie and me found a grave that looks like it's been busted into.
